# Spleen_segmentation_with_U-NET
CT scan segmentation with U-Net

In this notebook the data consists from one abdominal CT scan with segmentation of the spleen. 
There is not quite enough to train a reasonable model, however we can play with parameters and overfit our model to this particular case so that it produces a segmentation that looks good.
